# foggystreet-oauth-client
Source code for the (oauth2ClientAPI-1.0.jar) FoggyStreet client API code to provide helper methods to connect to any Auth2.0 server.

The following source code is for information purposes and provides assistance to developers who would like to write their own client code 
to connect to FoggyStreet OAuth authorization server.  There are 2 Jars not provided that are needed to compile the code.

The missing Jars are:

1) The encryption Jar package that is used to verify the JWT tokens, using the Public key and expiry dates.

2) Networking Jar that provides helper methods to perform HTTP/HTTPS GET POST calls.

If you have purchased a licence we are able to provide a copy of the encryption code to assist in your own client development.
